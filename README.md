=================
Python-based template to demonstrate the use of AI tools in web development, focusing on designing, building, and maintaining websites. This includes integrating AI tools for coding and automation purposes, which can streamline development and improve efficiency.
Setting up a Python-based Web Development Framework

While your primary tools include JavaScript, HTML, CSS, and WordPress, Python can assist with backend automation, data analysis, or integrating AI into web applications.

Hereâ€™s an example script for a web automation or AI-assisted website management tool using Python.
Python Code Example
1. Setup Environment

Install required libraries:

pip install flask openai requests beautifulsoup4

2. Using AI for Code Suggestions

Integrating OpenAI (e.g., GPT-4) to provide code suggestions or generate website content dynamically.

import openai
from flask import Flask, request, jsonify

# Initialize Flask App
app = Flask(__name__)

# OpenAI API Key
openai.api_key = "your_openai_api_key"

# AI-Assisted Content Generator
@app.route('/generate-content', methods=['POST'])
def generate_content():
    data = request.get_json()
    prompt = data.get('prompt', 'Generate a professional paragraph about web development.')
    try:
        response = openai.Completion.create(
            model="gpt-4",
            prompt=prompt,
            max_tokens=150,
            temperature=0.7
        )
        content = response['choices'][0]['text'].strip()
        return jsonify({'status': 'success', 'content': content})
    except Exception as e:
        return jsonify({'status': 'error', 'message': str(e)})

if __name__ == '__main__':
    app.run(debug=True)

3. Automating Website Updates with Python

Using Python for dynamic updates to a WordPress website via its REST API.

import requests

# WordPress REST API Configuration
WP_URL = "https://yourwordpresssite.com/wp-json/wp/v2/posts"
WP_USERNAME = "your_username"
WP_PASSWORD = "your_password"

# Create a New Blog Post
def create_blog_post(title, content):
    credentials = (WP_USERNAME, WP_PASSWORD)
    post_data = {
        "title": title,
        "content": content,
        "status": "publish"
    }
    response = requests.post(WP_URL, json=post_data, auth=credentials)
    if response.status_code == 201:
        print("Blog post published successfully!")
        return response.json()
    else:
        print(f"Failed to publish post: {response.status_code}, {response.text}")

# Example Usage
if __name__ == "__main__":
    title = "AI-Powered Web Development"
    content = "Discover how AI tools are revolutionizing the web development industry."
    create_blog_post(title, content)

4. Validate Website for Issues

Using Beautiful Soup to identify broken links or issues on the website.

from bs4 import BeautifulSoup
import requests

# Function to Check for Broken Links
def check_broken_links(url):
    response = requests.get(url)
    soup = BeautifulSoup(response.content, 'html.parser')
    links = soup.find_all('a', href=True)
    broken_links = []
    
    for link in links:
        href = link['href']
        try:
            link_response = requests.get(href, timeout=5)
            if link_response.status_code != 200:
                broken_links.append(href)
        except requests.exceptions.RequestException:
            broken_links.append(href)
    
    if broken_links:
        print("Broken links found:")
        for link in broken_links:
            print(link)
    else:
        print("No broken links found!")

# Example Usage
if __name__ == "__main__":
    check_broken_links("https://yourwordpresssite.com")

5. Frontend Automation with AI Tools

Integrating AI into your frontend development pipeline (e.g., generating dynamic forms).

@app.route('/generate-form', methods=['POST'])
def generate_form():
    data = request.get_json()
    fields = data.get('fields', ['Name', 'Email', 'Message'])
    form_html = "<form>"
    for field in fields:
        form_html += f"<label>{field}:</label><input type='text' name='{field.lower()}'><br>"
    form_html += "<button type='submit'>Submit</button></form>"
    return jsonify({'status': 'success', 'form_html': form_html})

Key Features

    AI-Generated Content: Dynamically generate content for websites or blogs using GPT-4.
    Automated WordPress Updates: Programmatically create and manage WordPress posts.
    Broken Link Checker: Validate the integrity of your website using Beautiful Soup.
    Dynamic Form Generation: Use AI to simplify repetitive UI tasks.

Next Steps

    Deploy this Flask app on a cloud service (e.g., AWS, Render, Heroku).
    Integrate with your existing WordPress site and connect frontend tools like JavaScript for seamless interaction.
    Leverage ClickUp or Slack APIs to notify teams about content changes or issues.
